        I am a Computer Scientist and a Mathematician from Spain. In August I moved to New York to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Theory at Columbia University. Due to COVID-19, I am currently continuing my Master online from Germany. This summer, I am doing an internship as Reverse Engineer at FireEye.

        Before starting my graduate studies, I have worked for three years as a Software Engineer at SUSE in Germany. I am a Free and Open-Source Software enthusiast and I can not avoid taking a look at every code that crosses my path. That is why I maintain several Free Software projects and contribute to many others as well. Some people say I am addicted to <a href="{{ site.data.contact.github_url }}" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!

        I am passionate about Computer Science and technology. I am specially interested in Theoretical Computer Science and I feel attracted to programming challenges. I enjoy working with different programming lenaguages and technologies. Some of my favourites are Ruby, Python, Assembly language, SQL, C and Haskell, but I am always willing to discover new ones.

        In my free time, I attend technical conferences, <a href="{{ site.data.cv.personal.activities.hiking }}" target="_blank">hike</a>, <a href="/gallery" target="_blank">paint</a> and <a href="{{ site.data.cv.personal.activities.cooking }}" target="_blank">cook</a>. When I find time and an interesting topic, I write in <a href="/blog">my blog</a>.
