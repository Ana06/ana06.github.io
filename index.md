        I am a Computer Science Engineer and a Mathematician from Spain. In August I moved to New York where I am pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Theory at Columbia University. Before starting my graduate studies, I have worked for three years as a Software Engineer at SUSE in Germany.

        I love Open Source development and I can not avoid taking a look to every code that crosses my path. That is why I maintain several Open Source projects and contribute to many others as well. Some people say I am addicted to <a href="{{ site.data.contact.github_url }}" target="_blank">Github</a>! I also help newcomers to Open Source, for example by participating as a mentor and org admin in GSoC.

        I am passionate about Computer Science and technology. I am specially interested in Theoretical Computer Science and I feel attracted by programming challenges. I currently write a lot of Ruby code, but I enjoy working with other programming languages and exploring different programming paradigms as well.

        In my free time, I attend technical conferences, <a href="{{ site.data.cv.personal.activities.hiking }}" target="_blank">hike</a>, <a href="/gallery" target="_blank">paint</a> and <a href="{{ site.data.cv.personal.activities.cooking }}" target="_blank">cook</a>. When I find time and an interesting topic, I write in <a href="/blog">my blog</a>.
